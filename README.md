# Attrition

# Introduction

In this project we will do a deep dive into factors that lead to Attrition. I will tackle this problem by first stating what i think are the leading factors to Attrition. Then later back my theories with a few charts. 

After presenting charts to back my theories, I will run a machine learning model to first predict Attrition,and later run another machine learning model to predict monthly income. I am excited about the results i will find, that i will use my owm work enviroment to predict attrition and monthly income. 

Finally, in the end of this project we will compare my factors and see whether they were one of the factors the models used to predict Attrition.
